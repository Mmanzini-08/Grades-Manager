# Grades-Manager
Just a little program I decided to built to keep track of one's grades in school.

I inserted some dummy data to test it out in the subjects.example.json

# How to install:
1. git clone https://github.com/Mmanzini-08/Grades-Manager.git
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) with "python -m venv .venv"
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
   - Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install dependencies with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
